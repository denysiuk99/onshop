# DenSH - BRANCH GUIDE

Following are the most important branches:

- `dev`: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**. Note that **all PRs must be against `dev` branch to be considered**.
- `master`: Synced time to time from dev. It contains "stable" code, although not the latest one. We plan to do periodic merges from `dev` to `master`.

Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time.

Thanks!
